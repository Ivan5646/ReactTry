Problems
- proxyConsole.js:56 Warning: validateDOMNesting(...): Whitespace text nodes cannot appear as a child of <tr>. Make sure you don't have any extra whitespace between tags on each line of your source code. See Table > TaskRow > tr > #text. 
- State data of FilterableProductTable passed to SearchBar and becomes props in SearchBar. Ok, but how do update state (if the function which should change state is in NewTask component)?
